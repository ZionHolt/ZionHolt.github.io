        <h2>Problem Statement: Time Management App for Computer Science Students</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science students at universities often face challenges in time management when dealing with intensive programming projects and theoretical assignments. They need a time management app that helps plan both short-term and long-term academic tasks and provides custom reminders and progress tracking. This app should be simple to use, seamlessly integrating with their daily study  routines, thus helping them improve learning efficiency, reduce procrastination, and complete high-quality academic tasks within strict deadlines.

        <p>
          The affinity diagram above is split into five distinct categories that each contain information about a certain part of our problem statement. These categories include the Application
          Features and User Interface, Development and Technology required, Business Model and Monetization, Accessibility, and Inclusivity, and finally Feedback, Growth, and Collaboration.
          Under these categories are multiple ideas or recommendations for how to implement features, who to make specific accommodations for, and methods of sustaining the app, among other things.

            The name of my persona is Ken Kaneki. The quote that best defines their personality is, "It's better
            to be hurt than to hurt others. Nice people can be happy with just that." and is included in the PDF.
